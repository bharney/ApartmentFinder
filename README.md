# YogaMarieMills
Forked version of coryhouse/react-slingshot. Project for dynamically bringing in data onto the page via API.

Project is a work in process. The end goal is to create a word-press like application, using Reactjs. The start was based on my dear ol' aunt having a crummy word press site which didn't look so great. This site will ultimately allow non-technical users to customize their content and display that data into a template.

Get started:

Using the package.json file you should be able to npm install. 

Once you have all of the dependencies, use npm start to kick it off.
